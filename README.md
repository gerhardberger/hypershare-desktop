> Currently only available for **[macOS](https://github.com/gerhardberger/hypershare-desktop/releases/download/v1.0/Hypershare-osx-1.0.0.zip)**.

You can share multiples files by generating a 64bit hash link. If another person
pastes this link in the download field of the app, it will be automatically
transferred peer-to-peer to the receiving person's system Downloads folder.
